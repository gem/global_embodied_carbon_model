# 🌱 European Embodied Carbon Model

This repository features the first continental-scale maps of replacement embodied carbon (REC) and average annual embodied carbon (AAEC) for Europe's entire building stock. The map of REC depicts the total carbon embodied in the existing residential, commercial, and industrial building assets, estimated at approximately 14 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e, which is more than twice Europe’s 2021 emissions. Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Spain together account for over 60% of the total replacement embodied carbon, with each country contributing between 1.1 and 1.8 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e. This concentration is expected, given that these nations possess the largest number of buildings and built-up areas.

The latter map presents the expected annual embodied carbon due to earthquake-induced damage and repair, offering a new lens to assess the environmental dimension of seismic risk. The total AAEC for Europe exceeds 6.6 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e per year, a value comparable to national-level sectoral emissions in countries like Norway and Serbia. The highest contributors are Turkey, Italy, Romania, Greece, Spain, and Bulgaria, those representing over 90% of the total AAEC in Europe.

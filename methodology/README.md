## Replacement Embodied Carbon

Buildings generate both embodied and operational carbon throughout their life cycles. Embodied carbon accounts for emissions associated with modules A1-A5, B1-B5, and C1-C4 (see Figure below), while operational carbon pertains exclusively to modules B6-B7. The carbon emitted during the material production stage can represent up to 50% of the whole life-cycle carbon (embodied + operational)[^1] and nearly 85% of the total embodied carbon [^2]. The second largest contribution comes from operational energy and water use (modules B6-B7). Emissions caused by earthquake damage and subsequent repairs contribute further to the embodied carbon during the building’s use stage (e.g., as part of modules B3-B5).

Our primary focus is the embodied carbon generated by repair and reconstruction activities following destructive events, such as earthquakes. Hence, for calculating the Replacement Embodied Carbon, we specifically address the directly relevant modules, as outlined in the workflow below: A1-A5, covering all cradle-to-practical-completion activities, and C1-C4, which encompass the end-of-life processes as part of pre-reconstruction activities.

For **modules A1-A3 (production)**, the embodied carbon of an individual component is calculated multiplying the quantity of component by the respective embodied carbon factor.

The embodied carbon of **module A4 (transportation to construction site)** is calculated by multiplying the transported mass and distance (with empty runs) from the factory to the construction site, with a suitable transport carbon factor (kg CO<sub>2</sub>e per ton km). Here, we assume that trucks (i.e., heavy-duty vehicles, HDVs) will travel an average distance of 120 km from factory to site for all materials and components, considering national manufacturers only [^3]. We further add 70% to this distance to account for empty return. The transported mass is determined as the product of quantities of components (structure + envelope) and their respective mass factors.

**Module A5 (construction)** captures the embodied carbon associated with the construction stage like installation, workers’ transportation, and waste management. We solely focus on installation processes and waste production. For the former, we compute the on-site diesel machinery emissions required to lift the main structural and envelope components, as the potential gravitational energy from lifting these components to half of the building’s height multiplied by a diesel carbon factor (kg CO<sub>2</sub>e per MJ). We then assume an average of 3% of waste materials [^3] are generated during the construction activities.

For the end-of-life stage of the existing building being replaced, we address the embodied carbon of **module C1 (demolition)** by assuming an average amount of carbon dioxide equivalents per unit area of de-construction [^3]. We treat **module C2 (waste transport)** similarly to module A4, but with a shorter travel distance of 50 km, given that landfill sites are typically local [^4]. We increase this distance by 50% to account for the return trips of empty trucks. For **modules C3 and C4 (waste processing and disposal)**, we compute the embodied carbon at an average rate of carbon dioxide equivalents for 1 kg of waste material [^3]. We also assume a percentage of waste materials landfilled, differentiated by region.

To develop databases of Replacement Embodied Carbon for various building typologies we have identified for each region the primary building typologies in terms of lateral load resisting system and main construction material (classified with the GEM Building Taxonomy v3.1) with which we construct buildings today. For each building typology we have cataloged the main structural members and non-structural components, their construction materials and their quantities (per square metre of built area). For each building typology we have combined the quantity of components with their respective carbon factors in order to obtain the replacement embodied carbon per square metre of built area.

To create Maps of the Replacement Embodied Carbon of European Buildings, we have reprocessed GEM exposure models ([v2023.1](https://github.com/gem/global_exposure_model)) by integrating the replacement embodied carbon, as the environmental equivalent of the replacement cost. Replacement values were assigned under the assumption of rebuilding existing assets with modern practices to ‘build back better’. This resulted in regional exposure maps benchmarking the replacement embodied carbon of the existing building stock.

## Seismic Embodied Carbon

To expand traditional seismic risk metrics and address the environmental impact of earthquakes, we introduce the concept of Average Annual Embodied Carbon (AAEC). We have computed the AAEC for each country, assuming a direct relationship with the average annual economic loss ratios (AALRs) from the latest GEM’s Global Seismic Risk Model ([v2023.1](https://zenodo.org/records/8409623)).
